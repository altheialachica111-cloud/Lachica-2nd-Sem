<h1>hello!!</h1>
<h2>oh</h2>
<h3>a blank screen glowed in silent night, </h3>
<h4>an idea formed one late night fight.</h4>
<h5>from bugs and errors, hope was born</h5>
<h6>a system was built till early morn</h6>
<h7>coffee cold, but focus strong.</h7>
<h8>debugging nights felt way too long.</h8>
<h9>each commit small, yet steps were clearer,</h9>
<h10>turning logic into somethingreal here.</h10>
<h11>red lines flashed, the build would break,</h11>
<h12>one small typo one big mistake</h12>
<h13>but patience grew with every try,</h13>
<h14>fix, commit, push, and aim sky high</h14>
<h15>the screen went green</h15>
<h16>the tests all passed</h16>
<h17>the hardest parts were in the past</h17>
<h18>a simple app</h18>
